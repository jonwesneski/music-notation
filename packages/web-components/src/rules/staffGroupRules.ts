/**
 * Resolves which staves should be joined by a brace/bracket connector.
 *
 * - `group="grand"` always pairs positionally with the immediate next
 *   sibling — no shared identifier support, since a grand staff (piano/harp)
 *   is inherently 2 staves. `groupId` is ignored for these staves.
 *   - A grouped staff with no next sibling produces a warning, no span.
 *   - A grouped staff whose next sibling also declares its own `group`
 *     produces a warning, no span — ambiguous (the second staff is trying to
 *     start its own grouping before the first one completed). The next
 *     sibling's own attempt is still evaluated on its own turn, so one bad
 *     pairing doesn't cascade-fail the rest of the measure.
 * - `group="bracket"` supports two ways to declare membership:
 *   - **With `groupId` set**: every staff sharing that exact `groupId` value
 *     (and `group="bracket"`) must be contiguous; the resolved span covers
 *     the whole contiguous run, however many staves that is.
 *     - A run of length 1 (the id matched only one staff) produces a
 *       warning, no span.
 *     - The same `groupId` value reappearing later in a separate,
 *       non-contiguous run produces a warning for that second run, no span
 *       (almost always a copy-paste mistake).
 *   - **With no `groupId`**: falls back to the same positional
 *     pair-with-next-sibling behavior as `group="grand"`, so existing
 *     2-staff bracket usage keeps working unchanged.
