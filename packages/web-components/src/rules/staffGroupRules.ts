// (groupId is ignored) — a warning with no span is produced if there's no
// next sibling, or if that sibling also declares its own group (ambiguous;
// the sibling's own turn is still evaluated separately so one bad pairing
// doesn't cascade). group="bracket" either shares a groupId across a
// contiguous run (a run of 1 is a warning; the same groupId reappearing in a
// second non-contiguous run is a warning for that second run), or with no
// groupId falls back to the same positional pairing as group="grand".
